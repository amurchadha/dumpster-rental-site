            There are few things that make a roof replacement, new deck construction or other 
            renovation or cleanup project around the house go as smoothly as having a dumpster 
            on hand to collect all of the trash and waste. Household renovation and maintenance 
            projects can generate large amounts of rubbish that may end up being ignored or 
            refused if you leave it out on the curb for the regular trash pickup.
